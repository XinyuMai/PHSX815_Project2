## General info
The simple experiment simulated will have at least one configurable parameter that can take different values, which are also sampled from an appropriate
probability distribution with at least one configurable parameter. We will study the posterior probability distribution of a parameter of interest and/or can simulate at least two different scenarios (different models/probability distributions or values of parameters associated with hypotheses) and perform an analysis of the output to evaluate how well these different scenarios can be distinguished from each other.
